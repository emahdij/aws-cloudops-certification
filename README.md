2. **Have AWS experience?** ‚Üí [Roadmap](roadmap.md) (jump to gaps)
3. **Ready to build?** ‚Üí [Projects](projects/) (showcase-ready deployments) -->

## What You'll Learn

## üìñ How to Use This Guide

Throughout these chapters, you'll see AWS CLI commands and Terraform configurations used in examples. Don't worry about memorizing these commands‚Äîthe goal is to become familiar with their patterns and usage. Each chapter concludes with hands-on labs where you can practice these commands and solidify your understanding in a real environment.
