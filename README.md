The story connects all labs together, so **try not to skip labs** - each builds on the previous ones.

## 💰 Cost-Conscious Learning

We prioritize **free tier usage** in all labs:
- Most labs are completely free
- Paid labs use minimal resources (typically $1-5)
- Clear cost warnings and cleanup instructions

**⚠️ Cost Note**: AWS pricing changes frequently. Check each lab for current estimates, and please contribute updates if you notice changes.
